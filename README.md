# README 

This repository serves as a testing ground to verify 
the correct behaviour of OpenLayers inside an 
angular7 project, especially its production 
build. 

## Usage

The project also tests the behaviour of OL inside an 
angular library (ol-integration). So you need to build 
the library first by running: 

`npm run build_lib`

Then you can go ahead and do 
the usual stuff: 

## NG-Client output

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build ol-integration` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
